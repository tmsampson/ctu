ctu: Command Line Task Utility
===============

ctu is a cross-platform command line task management system, which allows full control
and management of text based task lists directly from the terminal / shell. ctu allows 
tasks to be added, prioritised, listed, sorted, removed and cleared, using an intuative
command line syntax. Task lists are stored in a simple and hand-editable text
based format, ideal for sharing and maintaining personal todo lists.
